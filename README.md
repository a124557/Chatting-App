## Fullstack Chatting App

This project is fully functional but with only styling still a work in progress. This application allows users to register with and login with their credentials into a public chat room. It is created with React and Material UI on the frontend, and MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, JWT, and Bcrypt on the backend. User data is stored in a MongoDB database and passwords are hashed as a security measure. 

Features:

1. Allow user signups
2. Allow user logins
3. All users can chat with each other via a public chat room

Signups and logins are handled by '/register' and '/login' APIs on the Node backend.
