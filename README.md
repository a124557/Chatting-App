## Fullstack Chatting App

This project is a work in progress. It is created with React and Material UI on the frontend, and MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, JWT, and Bcrypt on the backend. User data is stored in a MongoDB database and passwords are hashed as a security measure. 

Current features are:

1. Allow user signups
2. Allow user logins

Signups and logins are handled by '/register' and 'login' APIs on the Node backend.
